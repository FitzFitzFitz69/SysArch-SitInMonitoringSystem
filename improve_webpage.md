# Computer Lab Monitoring System Improvements

We've created several script files that can be used to implement the requested improvements to the Computer Lab Monitoring System. Each script addresses a specific feature request and can be run independently to update the system.

## 1. End Session Without Reward Button

- Added a new button "End Session" next to the existing "End Session + Reward" button in the admin panel
- Created `end_sit_in_no_reward.php` which handles ending a session without adding behavior points
- Updated the active sessions display to include both options

## 2. Notifications System

- Created `notifications.php` with full notification handling functionality
- Added a notifications section to the student interface
- Implemented real-time notification count badge
- Notifications are triggered for:
  - Reservation approvals
  - Behavior points earned
  - Feedback read by admin
  - Leaderboard position changes

## 3. Leaderboard System

- Created `leaderboard.php` to track student attendance
- Shows top 10 students with their attendance counts
- Displays the user's current position even if not in the top 10
- Uses attractive medal indicators for the top 3 positions

## 4. Sit-in History Statistics UI

- Enhanced the history statistics with modern card layout
- Added three key metrics:
  - Total completed sessions
  - Total hours of study time
  - Sessions completed this month
- Used the website's theme colors (purple and pink accents)

## 5. Programming Language Usage Statistics

- Improved the SQL queries to better identify programming languages
- Added a modern bar chart visualization
- Used official language colors for each programming language
- Fixed percentage calculations
- Added better error handling for no data scenarios

## 6. Student Profile Edit Form

- Updated the course selection to include the complete list:
  - BS Information Technology
  - BS Computer Science
  - BS Information Systems
  - BS Accountancy
  - BS Criminology

## 7. Computer Control Module

- Confirmation dialog removed when toggling computer status (implemented in previous update)
- Computer status now reflected in both student reservation and admin sit-in modules

## How to Apply These Changes

To implement these improvements, run the following scripts in order:

1. `php update_homepage_css.php` - Adds necessary CSS styles to homepage.php
2. `php update_student_profile.php` - Updates the edit profile form with complete course list
3. `php student_sit_in_statistics.php` - Enhances the sit-in history statistics UI
4. `php update_programming_stats.php` - Improves the programming language usage statistics

Additionally, use the following modular files which have already been created:
- `end_sit_in_no_reward.php` - For ending sessions without rewards
- `notifications.php` - For the new notifications system
- `leaderboard.php` - For the attendance leaderboard

These improvements enhance both the visual appeal and functionality of the system while maintaining its existing feature set.
